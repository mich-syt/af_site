Since then, she has enjoyed arranging piano accompaniments and singing various Japanese songs, deciding to push the boundaries of both her singing and arrangement skills by choosing two harmonically complex and vocally challenging pieces by Joe Hisaishi. Through the performance, Jun Qi aims to convey the soulful beauty of the two pieces. <br> Joshia picked up piano when he was 4, and since then was awarded the young performer award while studying at ACJC MEP.
